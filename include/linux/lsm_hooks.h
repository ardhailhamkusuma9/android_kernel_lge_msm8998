/**
 * Security hooks for program execution operations.
 *
 * @bprm_set_creds:
 *	Save security information in the bprm->security field, typically based
 *	on information about the bprm->file, for later use by the apply_creds
 *	hook.  This hook may also optionally check permissions (e.g. for
 *	transitions between security domains).
 *	This hook may be called multiple times during a single execve, e.g. for
 *	interpreters.  The hook can tell whether it has already been called by
 *	checking to see if @bprm->security is non-NULL.  If so, then the hook
 *	may decide either to retain the security information saved earlier or
 *	to replace it.
 *	@bprm contains the linux_binprm structure.
 *	Return 0 if the hook is successful and permission is granted.
 * @bprm_check_security:
 *	This hook mediates the point when a search for a binary handler will
 *	begin.  It allows a check the @bprm->security value which is set in the
 *	preceding set_creds call.  The primary difference from set_creds is
 *	that the argv list and envp list are reliably available in @bprm.  This
 *	hook may be called multiple times during a single execve; and in each
 *	pass set_creds is called first.
 *	@bprm contains the linux_binprm structure.
 *	Return 0 if the hook is successful and permission is granted.
 * @bprm_committing_creds:
 *	Prepare to install the new security attributes of a process being
 *	transformed by an execve operation, based on the old credentials
 *	pointed to by @current->cred and the information set in @bprm->cred by
 *	the bprm_set_creds hook.  @bprm points to the linux_binprm structure.
 *	This hook is a good place to perform state changes on the process such
 *	as closing open file descriptors to which access will no longer be
 *	granted when the attributes are changed.  This is called immediately
 *	before commit_creds().
 * @bprm_committed_creds:
 *	Tidy up after the installation of the new security attributes of a
 *	process being transformed by an execve operation.  The new credentials
 *	have, by this point, been set to @current->cred.  @bprm points to the
 *	linux_binprm structure.  This hook is a good place to perform state
 *	changes on the process such as clearing out non-inheritable signal
 *	state.  This is called immediately after commit_creds().
 * @bprm_secureexec:
 *	Return a boolean value (0 or 1) indicating whether a "secure exec"
 *	is required.  The flag is passed in the auxiliary table
 *	on the initial stack to the ELF interpreter to indicate whether libc
 *	should enable secure mode.
 *	@bprm contains the linux_binprm structure.
 *
 * Security hooks for filesystem operations.
 *
 * @sb_alloc_security:
 *	Allocate and attach a security structure to the sb->s_security field.

 *	allocated.
 *	@sb contains the super_block structure to be modified.
 *	Return 0 if operation was successful.
 * @sb_free_security:
 *	Deallocate and clear the sb->s_security field.
 *	@sb contains the super_block structure to be modified.
 * @sb_statfs:
 *	Check permission before obtaining filesystem statistics for the @mnt
 *	mountpoint.
 *	@dentry is a handle on the superblock for the filesystem.
 *	Return 0 if permission is granted.
 * @sb_mount:
 *	Check permission before an object specified by @dev_name is mounted on
 *	the mount point named by @nd.  For an ordinary mount, @dev_name
 *	identifies a device if the file system type requires a device.  For a
 *	remount (@flags & MS_REMOUNT), @dev_name is irrelevant.  For a
 *	loopback/bind mount (@flags & MS_BIND), @dev_name identifies the
 *	pathname of the object being mounted.
 *	@dev_name contains the name for object being mounted.
 *	@path contains the path for mount point object.
 *	@type contains the filesystem type.
 *	@flags contains the mount flags.
 *	@data contains the filesystem-specific data.
 *	Return 0 if permission is granted.
 * @sb_copy_data:
 *	Allow mount option data to be copied prior to parsing by the filesystem,
 *	so that the security module can extract security-specific mount
 *	options cleanly (a filesystem may modify the data e.g. with strsep()).
 *	This also allows the original mount data to be stripped of security-
 *	specific options to avoid having to make filesystems aware of them.
 *	@type the type of filesystem being mounted.
 *	@orig the original mount data copied from userspace.
 *	@copy copied data which will be passed to the security module.
 *	Returns 0 if the copy was successful.
 * @sb_remount:
 *	Extracts security system specific mount options and verifies no changes
 *	are being made to those options.
 *	@sb superblock being remounted
 *	@data contains the filesystem-specific data.
 *	Return 0 if permission is granted.
 * @sb_umount:
 *	Check permission before the @mnt file system is unmounted.
 *	@mnt contains the mounted file system.
 *	@flags contains the unmount flags, e.g. MNT_FORCE.
 *	Return 0 if permission is granted.
 * @sb_pivotroot:
 *	Check permission before pivoting the root filesystem.
 *	@old_path contains the path for the new location of the
 *	current root (put_old).
 *	@new_path contains the path for the new root (new_root).
 *	Return 0 if permission is granted.
 * @sb_set_mnt_opts:
 *	Set the security relevant mount options used for a superblock
 *	@sb the superblock to set security mount options for
 *	@opts binary data structure containing all lsm mount data
 * @sb_clone_mnt_opts:
 *	Copy all security options from a given superblock to another
 *	@oldsb old superblock which contain information to clone
 *	@newsb new superblock which needs filled in
 * @sb_parse_opts_str:
 *	Parse a string of security data filling in the opts structure
 *	@options string containing all mount options known by the LSM
 *	@opts binary data structure usable by the LSM
 * @dentry_init_security:
 *	Compute a context for a dentry as the inode is not yet available
 *	since NFSv4 has no label backed by an EA anyway.
 *	@dentry dentry to use in calculating the context.
 *	@mode mode used to determine resource type.
 *	@name name of the last path component used to create file
 *	@ctx pointer to place the pointer to the resulting context in.
 *	@ctxlen point to place the length of the resulting context.
 *
 *
 * Security hooks for inode operations.
 *
 * @inode_alloc_security:
 *	Allocate and attach a security structure to @inode->i_security.  The
 *	i_security field is initialized to NULL when the inode structure is
 *	allocated.
 *	@inode contains the inode structure.
 *	Return 0 if operation was successful.
 * @inode_free_security:
 *	@inode contains the inode structure.
 *	Deallocate the inode security structure and set @inode->i_security to
 *	NULL.
 * @inode_init_security:
 *	Obtain the security attribute name suffix and value to set on a newly
 *	created inode and set up the incore security field for the new inode.
 *	This hook is called by the fs code as part of the inode creation
 *	transaction and provides for atomic labeling of the inode, unlike
 *	the post_create/mkdir/... hooks called by the VFS.  The hook function
 *	is expected to allocate the name and value via kmalloc, with the caller
 *	being responsible for calling kfree after using them.
 *	If the security module does not use security attributes or does
 *	not wish to put a security attribute on this particular inode,
 *	then it should return -EOPNOTSUPP to skip this processing.
 *	@inode contains the inode structure of the newly created inode.
 *	@dir contains the inode structure of the parent directory.
 *	@qstr contains the last path component of the new object
 *	@name will be set to the allocated name suffix (e.g. selinux).

 *	@len will be set to the length of the value.
 *	Returns 0 if @name and @value have been successfully set,
 *		-EOPNOTSUPP if no security attribute is needed, or
 *		-ENOMEM on memory allocation failure.

 *	success.

 * @inode_getsecid:
 *	Get the secid associated with the node.
 *	@inode contains a pointer to the inode.
 *	@secid contains a pointer to the location where result will be saved.
 *	In case of failure, @secid will be set to zero.
 *
 * Security hooks for file operations
 *
 * @file_permission:
 *	Check file permissions before accessing an open file.  This hook is
 *	called by various operations that read or write files.  A security
 *	module can use this hook to perform additional checking on these
 *	operations, e.g.  to revalidate permissions on use to support privilege
 *	bracketing or policy changes.  Notice that this hook is used when the
 *	actual read/write operations are performed, whereas the
 *	inode_security_ops hook is called when a file is opened (as well as
 *	many other operations).
 *	Caveat:  Although this hook can be used to revalidate permissions for
 *	various system call operations that read or write files, it does not
 *	address the revalidation of permissions for memory-mapped files.
